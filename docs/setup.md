# Getting started with GUAC Visualizer

## About

The GUAC Visualizer is an experimental utility that can be used to interact with
the GUAC services. It acts as a way to visualize the software supply chain graph
as well as a means to explore the supply chain, and prototype policies.

Since the GUAC Visaulizer is still in an early experimental stage, it is likely
that there may be some unexpected behavior or usage problems. For a more robust
use of GUAC, we recommend using the
[GraphQL interface directly](https://github.com/guacsec/guac/blob/main/demo/GraphQL.md).

## Requirements

### Tools

- npm
- yarn
- docker

### Services

The GUAC visualizer requires the running of the GUAC services. For more
information on how to do this, click
[here](https://docs.guac.sh/getting-started/).

## Getting started

If you already haven't, clone the GUAC visualizer repo. We highly suggest
cloning it in the same path as you clone the main
[GUAC repo](https://github.com/guacsec/guac).

```bash
git clone git@github.com:guacsec/guac-visualizer.git
```

Change directories into the repo.

```bash
cd guac-visualizer
```

All commands run throughout this guide should be in this working directory.

## Running the guac-visualizer from source

Install the guac-visualizer dependencies:

```bash
yarn install
```

The output should look like:

````
$ yarn install
yarn install v1.22.19
warning package-lock.json found. Your project contains lock files generated by tools other than Yarn. It is advised not to mix package managers in order to avoid resolution inconsistencies caused by unsynchronized lock files. To clear this warning, remove package-lock.json.

## Configuration

`GUAC_CONFIG_PATH` is an environment variable that specifies the path to the `guac.yaml` configuration file. This file contains settings for various GUAC services, including the GraphQL endpoint that the visualizer will connect to. By default, the visualizer assumes that the GraphQL server is run on `http://localhost:8080/query`. If your `guac.yaml` file specifies a different endpoint, setting `GUAC_CONFIG_PATH` will allow the visualizer to connect to the correct server.

To set `GUAC_CONFIG_PATH`, create a new file in the root of the project called `.env.local`. Inside this file, add the following line:

```bash
GUAC_CONFIG_PATH='/path/to/guac.yaml'
```

Replace `/path/to/guac.yaml` with the actual path to your `guac.yaml` file. Once this is done, the visualizer will use the settings from this file the next time it's run.

The `next.config.js` file contains the default configuration for the visualizer, including the default GraphQL endpoint. However, with the introduction of the `GUAC_CONFIG_PATH` environment variable, you no longer need to manually edit this file to change the GraphQL endpoint. Instead, just update your `guac.yaml` file and set `GUAC_CONFIG_PATH` as described above.

Note that any changes to the `guac.yaml` file or the `GUAC_CONFIG_PATH` environment variable will only take effect after you stop and restart the visualizer. Make sure to restart the visualizer any time you make changes to these settings.

## Run the guac-visualizer locally:

```bash
yarn dev
```

The output should look like:

```
$ yarn dev
yarn run v1.22.19
$ next dev
ready - started server on 0.0.0.0:3000, url: http://localhost:3000
info  - Using webpack 5. Reason: Enabled by default https://nextjs.org/docs/messages/webpack5
```

You can then go to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to
see the graph visualization.
